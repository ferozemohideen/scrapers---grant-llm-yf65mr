- Sub-2 second search response time
- 99.9% system uptime
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- 50%+ reduction in grant writing time
- 30%+ improvement in proposal success rate

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements

- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Node.js 16.x+ (development only)
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- MongoDB 5+
- Redis 6+

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tech-transfer-system.git
cd tech-transfer-system
```

2. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

3. Install development dependencies:
```bash
make install-dev
```

## Quick Start

### Development Environment

1. Start the development environment:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

make dev
```

Access the development environment at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Deployment

1. Build production images:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

2. Deploy the stack:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Initialize production data:
```bash
make init-prod
```
