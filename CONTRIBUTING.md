## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
The following tools are required for local development:
- Docker (version 20.10+)
- Node.js (version 16+)
- Python (version 3.8+)
- Git (version 2.30+)
- PostgreSQL (version 14+)
- MongoDB (version 5+)

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/tech-transfer-system.git
   cd tech-transfer-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Install Node.js dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   # Copy example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Start Docker containers
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Troubleshooting
- Database connection issues: Verify PostgreSQL and MongoDB services are running
- Docker errors: Ensure Docker daemon is running and you have necessary permissions
- Environment variables: Check .env file configuration matches local setup

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Docstring format: Google style
- Required imports ordering:
  1. Standard library
  2. Third-party packages
  3. Local application imports

### TypeScript/JavaScript Guidelines
- ESLint configuration must be followed
- Prettier for code formatting
- Use TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- Async/await preferred over Promise chains
- JSDoc comments for all public functions

### Documentation Requirements
- All public APIs must have docstrings
- Update README.md for new features
- Include examples for API changes
- Document configuration changes
- Update API documentation

### Logging Standards
- Use appropriate log levels:
  - ERROR: Unrecoverable errors
  - WARNING: Recoverable issues
  - INFO: Important operations
  - DEBUG: Development details
- Include contextual information
- No sensitive data in logs

## Branch Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature branches: `feature/TICKET-ID-brief-description`
- Bug fixes: `bugfix/TICKET-ID-brief-description`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/TICKET-ID-brief-description`
- Releases: `release/vX.Y.Z`

### Branch Protection Rules
- Main branch: Requires PR review
- Release branches: Requires security review
- No direct commits to protected branches
- Required status checks must pass

### Merge Requirements
1. Up-to-date with base branch
2. Passing CI/CD pipeline
3. Code review approval
4. Security review for sensitive changes
5. No merge conflicts

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Minimum coverage: 80%
- Required frameworks:
  - Python: pytest
  - JavaScript: Jest
- Test categories:
  - Input validation
  - Error handling
  - Edge cases
  - Security checks

### Integration Testing
- Minimum coverage: 70%
- Required scenarios:
  - API endpoints
  - Database operations
  - External services
  - Authentication flows
- Performance benchmarks must pass

### Test Data Management
- Use fixtures for test data
- No production data in tests
- Mock external services
- Clean up test data after runs

## Security Guidelines

### Encryption Requirements
- FIPS 140-2 compliance required
- Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Secure key management

### Data Retention
- 90-day retention policy
- Automated data cleanup
- Audit trail maintenance
- Backup verification

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access review
- Audit logging required
- Session management

### Security Scanning
Required tools:
- SonarQube for code quality
- OWASP Dependency Check
- Snyk for vulnerability scanning
- GitGuardian for secret detection
